I AM SHER LOCKED

```
    No... because I took your pulse. Elevated. Your pupils dilated. I imagine John 
    Watson thinks love’s a mystery to me, but the chemistry is incredibly simple 
    and very destructive. When we first met, you told me that a disguise is always 
    a self-portrait, how true of you, the combination to your safe – your 
    measurements. [Holds up her phone] But this, this is far more intimate. This is 
    your heart, and you should never let it rule your head. You could have chosen 
    any random number and walked out of here today with everything you worked for. 
    But you just couldn't resist it, could you? I've always assumed that love is a 
    dangerous disadvantage. Thank you for the final proof.
